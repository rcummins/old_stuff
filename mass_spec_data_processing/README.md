CIDS-processing
===============

MATLAB scripts to process Isodat output for carbonate clumped isotopes. 
A similar version of this script was originally coded in Excel, but Excel has limited data analysis capabilities and often picked up errors during copying and pasting, so I created this version in MATLAB to fix those problems.
